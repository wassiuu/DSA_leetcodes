'''
In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node 
(0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the 
(n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.

For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, 
and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes 
with twins for n = 4.
The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the 
maximum twin sum of the linked list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. 
All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6.
